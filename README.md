# Moodie<br>A movie recommendation engine

### Powered by the TMDB API<br> Written in Rust with the Leptos + Actix Web libraries

---
This is a personal project of mine I started as a way to get to know Rust with practical hands-on experience.

This project started as a simple CLI application before being upgraded to a web service - original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/rhysbratti/movie_recommendation)

After settling on Leptos for the front-end, "Moodie" is now a full stack application written in pure Rust. Leveraging the TMDB API, it makes movie recommendations based on user-provided criteria such as streaming services, genre, movie length, and more.

This project is still in very active development! I expect this project to evolve as I get more comfortable with Rust & Leptos
